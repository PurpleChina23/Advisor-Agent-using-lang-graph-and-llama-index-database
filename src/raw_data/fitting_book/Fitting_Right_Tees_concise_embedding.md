# Fitting for the Right Set of Tees (Concise, for Embedding)

## Why Tee Selection Matters
- Fitting includes **choosing the right tee markers**, not just heads/shafts/grips.
- Playing tees that match **swing speed / carry distance** keeps approach shots reasonable and improves scoring.
- Ego- or habit-driven tee choices can **erase the gains** from a proper club fitting.

## Core Idea
- On a par‑72 round, assume ~**36 putts** ⇒ **36 full/speed-based shots** cover the course yardage.
- **14 drives + 22 approach/other shots**: drive distance strongly controls average yardage left per approach.

## Club Distances by Golfer Type (Yards)
| Club | Pct of Driver | **PGA (112 mph)** | **Strong Am (100 mph)** | **Avg Male (88 mph)** | **Senior (76 mph)** | **Lady (64 mph)** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Driver | 100% | 280 | 250 | 215 | 161 | 126 |
| 3‑wood | 93% | 260 | 233 | 200 | 150 | 117 |
| 5‑wood | 88% | 246 | 220 | 189 | 142 | 111 |
| 3‑hybrid | 82% | 230 | 205 | 176 | 132 | 103 |
| 4‑iron | 77% | 216 | 193 | 166 | 124 | 97 |
| 5‑iron | 73% | 204 | 183 | 157 | 118 | 92 |
| 6‑iron | 69% | 193 | 173 | 148 | 111 | 87 |
| 7‑iron | 64% | 179 | 160 | 138 | 103 | 81 |
| 8‑iron | 59% | 165 | 148 | 127 | 95 | 74 |
| 9‑iron | 54% | 151 | 135 | 116 | 87 | 68 |
| PW | 49% | 137 | 123 | 105 | 79 | 62 |
| GW | 44% | 123 | 110 | 95 | 71 | 55 |
| SW | 39% | 109 | 98 | 84 | 63 | 49 |

> Distances are **guidelines**, not absolutes; use them to align tee boxes with realistic approach clubs.

## Worked Examples (Course Setup → Typical Approaches)
- **Par 72, 7200 yds, Championship tees**
  - **PGA‑caliber (112 mph)**: 14 × 280 = **3920 yds** off the tee → **3280 yds** left for 22 shots ⇒ **~149 yds/shot** (≈ **9‑iron**).
  - **Average male (88 mph)**: 14 × 215 = **3010 yds** off the tee → **4190 yds** left for 22 shots ⇒ **~190 yds/shot** (≈ **5‑wood**). Even pros struggle to hit/hold greens with a 5‑wood repeatedly.
- **Same golfer on members tees (6400 yds)**: 22 shots average **~154 yds** (≈ **5‑iron**) → **much fairer approaches**.

## Distance‑Challenged Golfers (Fitting Implications)
- **Definition**: Players whose **strength/speed** limits prevent reaching many par‑4s in regulation **even from forward tees**.
- **Lady golfer (≈64 mph)**: Driver ≈ **126 yds**, 3‑wood ≈ **117 yds** ⇒ **243 yds** combining two solid shots → any par‑4 **>243 yds** effectively **penalizes** GIR chances.
- **Senior male (≈80 mph)**: Driver ≈ **180 yds**, 3‑wood ≈ **165 yds** ⇒ **345 yds** in two shots → par‑4 **>345 yds** penalizes GIR.
- **Set makeup** when overcoming distance is hard:
  - Consider **longer driver length** (common on LPGA) to add speed (with fit/accuracy validated).
  - **More fairway woods / hybrids** in place of long irons (higher launch/easier from turf).

## Stronger Golfers (Fitting Emphasis)
- Prioritize **accuracy and gapping** over chasing +10 yds with driver.
- Ensure **wedge/short‑iron gapping** covers scoring ranges.
- Replace **long irons with hybrids** if they yield better launch/stop on greens.

## Shot Breakdown (Assume 36 Putts)
| Metric | **PGA 112 mph** | **Strong Am 100 mph** | **Avg Male 88 mph** | **Senior 76 mph** | **Lady 64 mph** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 14 drives (yds) | 3920 | 3500 | 3010 | 2254 | 1764 |
| 22 × 6‑iron (yds) | 4246 | 3795 | 3264 | 2444 | 1913 |
| **Total (yds)** | **8166** | **7295** | **6274** | **4698** | **3677** |

## Practical Use in a Fitting / KB Agent
- Ask: **“Which tees do you play?”** and **“Typical driver carry?”** to route to a fair tee set.
- Use the distance table to **map expected approach clubs** by tee yardage.
- If GIRs are unrealistic from current tees, recommend **moving up a set**; adjust **set composition** accordingly.
